Micro Agile
===========

Agile product development for small teams.

## Sprints

Sprints are usually 1-2 weeks in length.

### Sprint Planning Meeting

A 1-2 hour meeting in two, sometimes three parts:

1) Stakeholders & team - discuss the priorities for the sprint
2) Team - discuss how they will go about tasks.
3) Product manager & stakeholders - confirm priorities with stakeholders after team estimations and discussion. This can be a quick 5 minute check-in.

__Estimates:__ teams can provide estimates to tasks if they wish. Estimates can help to measure a team's velocity (user story points are best for this) and can help with planning and communicating expectations to stakeholders (sometimes time based estimates are useful here).

__Goals & Milestones:__

1) Sprint-goals: span one or multiple sprints (e.g )
2) Team goals: specific goals for team members (e.g learn React.js)
3) Milestones: more major and often time-bound, can tie-in to larger business milestones (e.g launch new homepage and PR campaign)

### Sprint Demo Meeting

The development team present and discuss the latest work to stakeholders and the wider team and can discuss upcoming work. Also a good time for a team retrospective.

## Daily Scrums

Morning time team get-together, 10-20 mins. Say 1) what you did yesterday 2) what you're planning today 3) if anything is blocking you. Discuss outstanding work and how you can help each other

## Tickets

__Story:__ an outline of some functionality without too much specific detail.
See [Gov.uk/user-stores](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/writing-user-stories)

__Task:__ a discrete and already specified task

__Bug:__ something broken with an already deployed

__Design & Research:__ a design task, or a research task

__Meta Task:__ a list of small tasks (e.g 'high priority homepage issues')

__Epic:__ either 1) a new product feature (e.g 'messaging system v1', blog v3) or 2) a group of general ongoing updates (e.g 'infrastructure', 'frontend', 'login system')

### New Tickets

* Highest priority tickets -> add to this sprint and start ASAP
* High priority tickets -> next sprint
* All other -> backlogs

### Workflow

* Todo
* In progress -> update ticket with testing info, add pull request when a ticket is complete
* Ready for testing or deployment -> someone tests, code reviews, discusses, more work is usually done, and then the developer who worked on the ticket deploys
* Deployed or complete

## Backlogs

1) __Current sprint:__ all tasks currently in development
2) __Development backlog:__ ready for development
3) __Backlog:__ ideas, will need more specification and discussion before development

## Team Roles

* Developer: executes the development tasks
* Product Manager: guides the team, sets challenges for the team, manages meetings and backlogs
* Stakeholder: defines the higher-level business objectives

## Product Roadmaps

Group product feature epics into 'short-term', 'medium-term' and 'future'
